/*
 * The FAQ act, simulated rather than keyframed.
 *
 * A rolled rope ladder is strung on the blossom bough. The bough is hauled
 * back and pinned; the act lets go of it, and a beat later it lets go of the
 * roll. Nothing after that is scripted. Gravity pays the ladder out a rung at
 * a time — each cord hangs slack until the rung below it has fallen past, so
 * the release runs down the ladder rather than happening to it — and the last
 * cord to catch loads the whole rope at once. Rope is elastic, so that arrival
 * is stored rather than absorbed and comes straight back out: the ladder
 * recoils, bounces smaller, and settles onto the layout the CSS already
 * describes.
 *
 * Sideways is a second, separate pendulum. The two cords hang off two points
 * on the same limb, so the limb's swing carries the ladder's top with it while
 * the weight below lags. The rungs trail, but they stay level: a rung is a
 * plank of text, and text that rolls with the rope is unreadable, so the
 * ladder leans without ever turning.
 *
 * Scrolling back up tows the act away — see `createReelSim` at the foot of
 * this file, which drags each bough out through its own side of the frame
 * with the ladder trailing on the same cord physics.
 *
 * Rates and times below are in *simulation* seconds. The ticker feeds this
 * real time divided by TIME_SCALE, so the act plays out that much slower than
 * these numbers read on their own. Nothing else is touched — gravity,
 * stiffness and damping are what they were — which is what keeps the slowed
 * motion a real fall rather than a fall on a slow tape.
 *
 * No DOM in here: `world` is plain measured geometry, handed over by
 * useFallingLadder.js, and the solver writes its state back onto it.
