/*
 * Binds the FAQ act's simulation to the DOM.
 *
 * Measured, not authored: every position the solver needs is read off the page
 * as it already lays out — where the boughs sit, where each cord hangs, where
 * the rows would be if nothing had moved — so the act owns no geometry of its
 * own and the ladder ends it exactly on its own layout.
 *
 * Where a cord ties on is sampled out of the bough artwork. The plate is a
 * bitmap, so the underside of the limb is traced in limbCurve.js and the knot
 * goes at the y that trace gives for the cord's x. From then on the knot is a
 * point pinned to the limb: it turns and slides with it, and the ladder hangs
 * off wherever it has got to.
 *
 * The act plays once, in real time, when the journey arrives at it, and is
 * towed off through the frame's sides when the journey leaves it going the
 * other way. Neither is scrubbed
 * — a fall stepped through by a scroll wheel is not a fall — so this owns the
 * whole act, the boughs and the FAQ panel included: it shows them as the fall
 * begins and only hides them once the rope is home, which is what keeps the
 * reel on screen long enough to be seen.
